        69=It's glad at last to see reasonable humanoid, who knows which damage chemical stimulants could cause to him.<br>We can <clr>remove stimulants<clrEnd> by injecting special substance that reacts with stimulants molecules and cause to their mutual destruction. This procedure is pretty simple and absolutely harmless. Its main benefit is that we can remove <clr>only the stimulants you will ask for<clrEnd>, while all others will stay untouched. But remember, while removing the stimulants stops their harmful effects on your body, to fix the already caused damage <clr>its not enough<clrEnd>.<br>Additionally we could carry out <clr>the complex cleaning<clrEnd> of your body from any stimulants, harmful substances, bacteria and parasites simultaneously. Such cleaning will not only free your body from harmful effects of stimulants, but also will allow to temporarily <clr>increase the overall immunity<clrEnd> and, as a result, resistance to various diseases. In interests of your own health, I would strongly recommend you to pay attention on exactly this procedure.<br>According to the results of the analysis, the following stimulants are contained at your body now:<br> <br><0>
        70=We removed the <0> stimulant from you body, and although the caused damage we couldn't fix, at least you can no longer afraid of greater complications from now on.<br><1>
        71=It's your right, but I ask you, please, think again. Stimulants are addicted, destroy your immune system and causes hard damage to your health. Rejection of them will only benefit you!

Your pirate rating gives you a discount of: <clr><0>%<clrEnd>.<br>And that's what we do have at this day::<br><1>Keep in mind - we do not conduct any scans here. This is an another reason why <clr>you take all upcoming responsibility<clrEnd>. If you feel you couldn't stand it - don't implant it, but the final decision is up to you. We're not nannies to wipe your snot.
        135=Get tired of implants? We have possability <clr>to remove<clrEnd> them too. No any problems will arise, we will print all your missing tissues on the 3D-bioprinter. Yeah, we could do that too! Cool, right?<br>By the way, didn't you forget we got special prices for our mans? Your pirate rating gives you a discount of: <clr><0>%<clrEnd>.<br>Here is what we can cut off:<br>---<br><1>---<br>Well, what to remove?
        52=And... here we finished. All things nice and done, the seams are almost invisible, and the biomodule <0> is completely <clr>connected and ready to go<clrEnd>. By the way, didn't you know that many ladies downright trudge from such a pieces of iron, eh? I recommend you to use that, if you know what I mean.<br>And while you calculating last information we can install you a few more implants, if you'd like, of course.
        33=Wish to expand possibilities of your body? Commendable. Many nowadays think about the same. Greatly <clr>improved skills<clrEnd>, brand <clr>new abilities<clrEnd>, and all you need to do is just pay some money and spend several hours on the operating table.

Some complications may arise after a while and I don't even talk about <clr>the stress<clrEnd> that every biomodule will cause to your body. In general, we strongly recommend that you take such decision with full responsibility and seriousness.<br>In our turn, we will provide you with the highest quality medical care and only proven <clr>licensed<clrEnd> implants, which is a very important, really, unless you want some cheap Rahish fake suddenly stoped right inside your body. On such things it is better not to save.<br>If you'd like <clr>to know more<clrEnd> about the biomodules, you may listen to our briefing, especially if you interesting implants for the first time.
        150=Wish to expand possibilities of your body? Commendable. Many nowadays think about the same.

In general, we strongly recommend that you take such decision with full responsibility and seriousness.<br>In our turn, we pledge to provide you with the highest quality medical care and only proven <clr>licensed<clrEnd> implants. Yes, no matter our medcentre placed in the pirate system, where should be quite easy to find a cheap counterfeit, we still continiue to order our implants only from trusted suppliers or the manufacturers themselves directly.<br>If you'd like <clr>to know more<clrEnd> about the biomodules, you may listen to our briefing, especially if you interesting implants for the first time.
		94=Listen to the briefing
        44=Alright. As I said, we offer only <clr>licensed<clrEnd> biomodules, but this won't protect you from complications entirely. Before the start we will carry out several tests, and if they show that your body cannot stand with the subsequent stress, then you'll be <clr>denied<clrEnd> in surgery. Of course, all tests are free.<br>So, thats what we may offer this time:<br><0>And one little scanning now...<br><1>
        136=Can't be disagree with your decision. Biomodules surely are<clr>useful<clrEnd>, but also very <clr>insidious<clrEnd>. You may easily lost the moment there you will lost a part, or yourself entirely. The great gaal philosophist and iike-banist Guu-Amp once said:<br>Whan one of the flowers fades in your iike-bana, and then you replaced it, this is still the same iike-bana as it was. And then another flower fades, and you replaced it too, and than another and another. At the end, you replaced all the flowers. Is this still the same iike-bana? Or no more?...<br>Do you understand, <clr>how deep<clrEnd> is that thought and how it describes your state now? Did you listen to me at all? Ahh, no matter, your business.
        37=<0>
        160=It is important to understand that biomodules, or, in the science language, <clr>bionic modular augmentations<clrEnd> are far from beenig safe as it may seem at first glance. Of course, thay won't make you addicted like stimulants, but some <clr>kind of stressing<clrEnd> on your body these biomodules are certainly does.<br>Every living creature able to stand only the strictly defined severity stress, and if it is exceeded, various <clr>complications<clrEnd> will immediately appear - severe pain, difficulty in managing bionic prostheses, sometimes even hallucinations. We call this condition - <clr>augmentational fever<clrEnd>. <clr>No treatment<clrEnd> are exist for now. The only way to beat this is to lower stress on your body or to raise the threshold of its endurance.<br>You should be interesting, how to avoid such complications? Its nothing difficault actually, just be careful and don't implant everything you see.<br>Also you should be know that endurance of every humanoid body depends directly <clr>on his race<clrEnd>. In dry numbers, abstracting from any individual features, we can get such picture: <clr>Feis<clrEnd> got the lowest endurance through any other race, <clr>Gaals<clrEnd> are a bit tougher, <clr>Peoples<clrEnd> and <clr>Pelengs<clrEnd> are bit harder than Gaals, and, naturally, absolute champions here are <clr>the Malocs<clrEnd>.
        39=Of course, endurance can be improved. Many <clr>stimulants<clrEnd>, and by last researches, even <clr>some diseases<clrEnd> can raise the endurance of the body. Perhaps the best choice in this case may be the <clr>Bloody djogar<clrEnd>, but in general, any stimulants that strengthen body, improve brain function or increase willpower, in some way helps to fight the stress. Its important to understand that totally all stimulants are just a <clr>temporary solution<clrEnd>.<br>In addition, it is always necessary to remember about <clr>diseases<clrEnd>. Yes, some of them might help your body to stand the stress, but most <clr>will only interfere it<clrEnd>.<br>From the above, it is logical to follow two simple ways to prevent augmentational fever - inject the stimulants and treat diseases. Of course, this still might be not enough, especially if the augmentational fever did already started.<br>For this case there's only last, most radical and most effective way - <clr>removing<clrEnd> some or all of the implanted biomodules.
		140=And finally, you might be interesting, <clr>how much<clrEnd> of the implants my body can get?<br>You see, the max count of the implants limits not only by the stress level, but also by specific physiological features of your body. Lets example, hypothetically, it's possible to install <clr>four bionic arms<clrEnd> simultaneously to anyone, but successfully using of this arms will be allows only to Pelengs, while all other races bodys will simply be unable to cope with two extra limbs. The similar situation is with rest of the body parts.<br><clr>Feis<clrEnd>, thanks to their compound structure of the brain, can effectively use <clr>up to four cerebral implants<clrEnd> simultaneously, while all other races able to coordinate just two. From the birth time, <clr>Gaals<clrEnd> have three eyes and, therefore, can effectively use <clr>up to three eye biomodules at once<clrEnd>.<br>Heres, in fact, all the general information. Now with your new knowledges about possible risks and opportunities we can invite you into the operating theater, with a clear conscience.
        46=We also provide services of <clr>removing<clrEnd> implanted biomodules. Despite the obvious complexity of such operations, we can guarantee complete safeness and postoperative comfort.<br>For <clr>restoring all the missing tissues<clrEnd> artificially grown stem cells are used, and in some very severe cases - partial cloning. You can be absolutely calm: even if you replaced most of your body by cybernetic, we will be able to reassemble you without any loss of functionality.<br>So, at this moment you have next biomodules installed:<br>---<br><0>---<br>Which to remove?
        137=Ah... well, biomodules is a good stuff. But keep in mind - <clr>not very safety too<clrEnd>.<br>However, I'm not going to ship you all this garbage. If you interested then fly to these <clr>dupetors<clrEnd> and they will tell you all in row. We are making business with self-sufficient, independent and responsible persons. <clr>No guarantees<clrEnd>, exept for selling and installing you cheap implant, so if some kind of trouble occur - don't come back with complaints.<br>Because of our accessibility to the places you can't even guess of existences, we can get implants relatively cheap. On average, we sell them <clr>one third cheaper<clrEnd> than on medical centers, but you should belive, they overprice it only for brand label, while all official functionality of our implants <clr>is on its place<clrEnd>. But the most interesting is the <clr>prohibited biomodules<clrEnd>.<br>You can't even imagine how much of the top interesting implants Coalition annually prohibits for various reasons. You can't find them on official stores but here we <clr>occasionally come across them<clrEnd>. These implants are usually pretty expensive, but believe me, if something ever cost its price - this is it.<br>And heres some sad news: equipment is a piece of hobsaur feces. With all professionalism our surgeons can show, working on THIS - hell of a task. Complications after surgery are almost inevitable. Because of this, result body stressing is about <clr>one and a half times higher<clrEnd> than analogs installed in medical centers. I share this to you to not hear your whining after.<br>So, if you have no problems with all of the above, then, as they say, welcome aboard!
		55=Congratulations, biomodule <0> successfully <clr>removed<clrEnd>... well, and something else on the little things. A little scar will remain, but it's not too much to worry about, right? But besides the listed no consequences. You're just as good as new!<br>If you wish to remove something else, we could bring you back on surgery table even right now - no big deal.
        130=Well why the klisan you take me away from my business?<br>Don't like our conditions - go to the dupetors. We are not going to nurse here with you. You need biomodule - we will implant it, if you don't - don't waste our time.
        72=Your body are <clr>not contain any stimulants<clrEnd> right now, but we still glad that you worry about your health so much. Keep up that way - will live long and rich life.
        73=That's it. We did complex body cleansing from any stimulants or whatever harmful factors. You are now pure as a baby.<br>This procedure will help your body <clr>to stand any diseases<clrEnd> for a while, because it has nothing to fight with within itself now.<br>Try not to waste our efforts and keep healthy lifestyle from now on.
        74=Refuse vaccinations
        117=Vaccination of <0> (<1> cr).
        119=Vaccination of
        121=Vaccinations are an extremely useful procedure. It gives you <clr>almost proof resist<clrEnd> to particular disease for a quite large period of time.<br>Our medical centers chain has always advocated compulsory vaccination, but in last time the <clr>antivaccination movement<clrEnd> raised its popularity and according to the law, we were also obliged to talk about the shortcomings of this method...<br>At first, vaccinations might cause <clr>the weakening of general immunity<clrEnd>. There's <clr>ain't no science proves<clrEnd> to that, but we should warn you about this possibility anyway.<br>At second, if your immune ain't strong enough it might can't handle even with weakened virus, which contained in vaccine, and this might couse you <clr>may get sick<clrEnd> some time after vaccination. That's why we not recommend to leave our station right after vaccination or, at least, not fly out too far.<br>In third, any organism is able to support the production of only a limited types number of antibodies, becouse if its number will raise, then they can begin to perceive each other in the role of threatening the body and than... Let's just say that we <clr>can't allow more than 3 vaccinations at same time<clrEnd>. Believe - it's for your own good.<br>I want to hope, that all of the above will not be a problem for you when you will be making vaccination decisions.<br>And now to business. At current moment your body contains <0> types of antibodies. This means that we can make <1> vaccinations for the next diseases:<br> <br><2>
        122=Well-well... Let's see... No, you body contain <clr>too much different antibodies<clrEnd> so new vaccinations will have bad consequences.<br>Fly to us later, when your current vaccinations will expire, but now I ask you to not slowing the queue.
        154=Great. One little sting... Like a bite of mosquito... That's it.<br>From now on <0> will not bother you for a couple of years. Want a candy? No? Alright then... Anything else?
        79=Your right. Although I personally believe that vaccinations are the most effective way to preserve your health. But this is a purely voluntary matter - you don’t want it, we don't make it.<br>How else can I help you?
		138=We glad that you know when to stop. Despite its obvious usefulness, nor should you neglect the danger that biomodules can carry.<br>Most importantly, do not forget to monitor your health and <clr>at the first signs of complications<clrEnd>, if such occur, <clr>return to us<clrEnd> as soon as possible.
        141=You sure? We still could replace you something else.<br>Do you want penchecryck's eyes? Maybe jhvirclatz's gills? Don't wanna, huh? Well, okay. Enjoy your new body parts, but if you change your mind and wish to screw some more iron, I will be right here.
