To provide device with enough energy, it was necessary to completely redo the power supply system and, in particular, to dismantle the grab slot.

        176=The newest sheathing already delivered and now fixing on the bearing structures. Thanks for cooperation, now our personall got 20 additional seconds to run for escaping pods, whan dominators will attack this system.
        177=Great! Our virtuosos of autogen and sledgehammers have already bought everything that was necessary and set into work. A new compartment and related communications system will soon be put into operation. All works will be done in blink of an eye.
        286=This is an experimental system of super precision targeting, specifically designed for Coalition space stations.

        218=Thanks to you, station now equipped with most longrange weapon systems. <clr>"Hurricane"<clrEnd> installed and calibrate, and all gunners already undergoing an express course of studing to work with the new neural interface.
        348=Not long ago a new defensive techology for a space ships was developed. It's uses the directed singular matter distortion principle and can rise defensibility by point matter distortion in spots, hitted by enemy shells. Also it's perform space distortion in the path of your own shots which leads to increasing firepower.<br>A massive generator implanted in hull and uses its parts to form up his active field.

        350=It's not a secret that all around materials for modern ships construction are extremely expensive. Besides, armor plates need to be replaced entirely for too often, because they just split and crumble into pieces.<br>Our engineers had an idea for a long time: to change all station's armor on polixenate one. Polixenate - its newest composite plastic, which is not inferior to conventional armor at ultra low temperatures and also extremely easy to maintain.<br>We're ready to take off our current armor and sell it for a part of pricing.

		204=Well-well, welcome to the space station with plastic armor! Don't you be sad, improving of our base is a lot cheaper now, plus repairing it from your pocket will cost significantly less.
        214=Well, that's really sad, but it's your business. Sign here and here and from now on our development are under Galactic Council jurisdiction. Anyway, thank you for your cooperation.

        336=At this moment <0> is in defensive mode.<br>Our command respects your merits and combat experience, so you can choose where the station will go in the near future. We are ready to fulfill your order.

Or we could use our long range hyperdrive for immediately jump to other system.<br>Don't forget, our main task is defence of the sector <3>, so we can't jump outside of it.
        318=Launching propulsion engines in 3.. 2.. 1.. G... oh hell! That was a harsh kick! So what now, ranger, do you feel all might of Interstellar Coalition already?<br>Five seconds, normal flight...<br>Time expected to complete the maneuver: <0> days<br>Don't forget, it's impossible to landing or taking off during movement, so we need to stop first.
        290=At this moment our military base executing relocation. We fly at speed of <0> mln. km. per day and will reach target location through <1> days.<br>Would you have any additional instructions?
        287=Stop! Order received, our military base is switching to station mode.
        353=Launching propulsion engines in 3.. 2.. 1.. Go-oo!..<br>...Wait a second, why didn't we going nothere? It seems, that powers of our current engines is not enough to achiv appropriate speed!<br>Minimal speed for the flight is <0> mln. km. per day, and our engines can only accelerate the station up to <1> mln. km. per day. It seems, for inner system flights we do need more powerful engine.
        354=At this time our base prepearing to strike enemy system. This task came from Galactic Council and have higher priority, so all relocations for now is prohibited. By the way, you can join us in this operation.
        282=Thanks to your money, base were totally rebuild. Now it's shine as new! Check out available upgrades, it surely must have something new to screw in now.
        266=Tactical map of the system is before you <0>.<br>================================<br>Our station coordinates:<br>(<1>, <2>)<br>================================<br><br>We can set a course on one of the planets position.<br><br>Show us the target location.
        298=Choose the target system
        331=We are ready to jump immidiately! The target - system <0>.<br>I remind you that work of our hyperdrives is accompanied by severe overloads, therefore ships and passengers are not allowed to stay at the station during hyper-jump, and our cryochambers currently inactive. You should leave the base immediately.
        310=System <0> is under enemy control and our military base cannot participate offense operations without an order from Galactic Council.<br>We are able to commence a jump to only Coalition systems.
        311=Station are preparing to hyperjump. Cryochambers and stasis-generator disabled for now, so we can't execute the jump with some other ships on board.<br>You should make your way to the hangar and leave this base immediately for your own safety.
        355=Leave this system and jump to another? But we can't leave billions of inhabitants without protection! Let's better show these punks together how much they mistaken when they came here!
        330=Your communicator were tuned for channel of <0> station and soon capitan's serious face appeared on the screen.<br><br>"<1> on line. What do you want, ranger?"
        320=Your communicator were tuned for channel of <0> station and soon capitan's serious face appeared on the screen.<br><br>"Station <0> are preparing to hyperjump. Cryochambers and stasis-generator disabled for now, so we can't execute the jump with some other ships on board. Keep your distance."
        328=There's another military base already in <0> system. High Command don't allow presence more than one military bases at the same system.
        329=Quantity of a space stations at <0> system for now is enough to not worry about its defensive potential. We think that jump there will be ineffective solution.

Relocation are impossible.
        342=As you should know, our station hyperdrives differs a lot by their power from that installs on regular ships. Overloads during flight exceed all permissible norms, so all passengers should be sustain in special cryochambers and all transported ships should be covered by stasis-field. We did not planned to make a jumps anytime soon so we can't take any passengers on board.<br>You need to get in touch from your ship's bridge after takeoff to give a hyperjump order.
        340=Your communicator were tuned for channel of <0> station and soon harsh capitan's face appeared on the screen.<br><br>"Well-well, look what the mug I can see on my screen! You've done the wrong thing, <Player>, and soon you will learn it, you pathetic renegade! We sent for you already and all our guns also pointing at your ship. Don't even try to stutter about your rights - we will never let you make it for the court-martial anyway!"
        343=All crew, be ready to the jump! Ranger, make some distance and watch the infrequent show.
        358=Your communicator were tuned for channel of <0> station and soon surprised capitan's face appeared on the screen.<br><br>"<1> on line. Who the hell allowed pirate ships to call in? Disconnect. Immediately!"
