        127=Our hackers can get temporary access to any of ranger's node accounts during the DDoS attack. By this we may transyt any number of nodes from account to account with no much attention in process. What we'll do next with transmitted nodes and where do we get real nodes for you is not your business.<br>What you should really know is what for security reasons, all transitions will occur in form of microtransactions of 1 node each.<br>Accordingly, the more nodes you want to uh ... "withdraw", the longer we have to DDoS, which leads to additional risks. I see you already catch the point.<br>Well, <clr>every withdrawn node will cost you 10 cr.<clrEnd>
